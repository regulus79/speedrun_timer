# Speedrun Timer
A minetest mod which adds a timer for speedrunning games

## How to use

### The easy way
When you join the game, the timer initally reads `0:00:00.00`.

The timer will automatically start once you **press any action key**.

The timer can be stopped either by pressing `Shift+E` (or whatever sneak+aux1 are bound to).

### Chatcommands
The timer can also be controlled via chatcommands.

`/reset` - Resets the timer to 0 and pauses it.

`/start` - Starts the timer if it was paused.
